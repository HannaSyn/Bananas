# Bananas

My thought process:

1. Determine the first step

  1.1 Select all first elements from each array
  1.2 Choose the largest of them
  1.3 Determine the index of an array with this element


2. Describe the possible step map (row and column)


  2.1 Find column of next item
  2.2 Determine the maximum and minimum possible row
  2.3 Based on the found indexes, select values from an array and create a map from them


3. Find the maximum value from the map
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all subsequent elements
